<p>A Fantasy Cricket Match is based on batting and bowling orders which are the most debated part of cricketing strategy. A little change in the order can change the course of the game. The concept involves selecting a team of 11 players and 3 substitutes from the pool of players who will play the match. There are no budget caps and player selection is not limited to a particular number of batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders. A fantasy team can have any type of players. The main aim in a Fantasy Cricket Match is to out-score the opposition by as big margin as possible. Fantasy cricket matches can be played in all 3 international forms: One Day International, Twenty20 and Test Cricket. The limited over matches, namely ODIs and T20s, are played in 2 interesting formats- Daily Games and Rounds</p><br>

<p>Fantasy Cricket is classified as a Game of Skill similar to Fantasy Sports in the United States. Fantasy Cricket for Cash is at the hub of three dynamic industry spokes, namely, Internet, Gaming and Cricket.

Defining Skill: Supreme Court of India has explained skill in terms of superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and adroitness. The Supreme Court of India, in K.R. Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu, stated as follows: A game of skill, on the other hand – although the element of chance necessarily cannot be entirely eliminated – is one in which success depends principally upon the superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and adroitness of the player.

The relevant excerpt from the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in K.R. Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1996 SC 1153[1] is: There are few games, if any, which consist purely of chance or skill, and as such a game of chance is one in which the element of chance predominates over the element of skill, and a game of skill is one in which the element of skill predominates over the element of chance. It is the dominant element – “skill” or “chance” – which determines the character of the game.

The Court categorically stated the meaning of skill (in Paragraph 20 of the case), in the following terms: We, therefore, hold that the expression “mere skill” would substantial degree or preponderance of skill. In the above case, the Court was considering Section 11 of the Tamil Nadu Gaming Act, which excluded the application of the act to games of ‘mere skill’, and is in pari materia with Section 12 of the Public Gambling Act of 1867.[2] Interestingly, in that case the Court concluded that horse-racing was a game of skill.</p>
